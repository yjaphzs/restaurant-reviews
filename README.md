# RESTAURANT REVIEWS (2018)

**Undergraduate Course Project**

**Restaurant Reviews** is a CRUD-based application designed to help users browse, rate, and review local restaurants. It aims to provide a simple platform for discovering dining spots based on user feedback and location.

The system consists of the following components:

- **Node.js + Express Backend API** to handle restaurant data and user reviews.
- **AngularJS Frontend** for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **MongoDB Database** to store restaurants, users, and reviews.
- **Leaflet.js** for displaying restaurant locations on an interactive map.
